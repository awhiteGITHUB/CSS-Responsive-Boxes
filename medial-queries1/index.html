        <h2>FRISCO, Texas â€“ The Cowboys' season has ended, but Micah Parsons keeps collecting awards.</h2>
        <p> This time, the dynamic linebacker has been named Rookie of the Year/Defensive Rookie of the Year by the Professional Football Writers of America.

          Parsons' latest honor isn't much of a surprise given his production as an off-the-ball linebacker and situational pass rusher this season. He posted a franchise rookie record 13.0 sacks and tied for the NFL lead with 20 tackles for loss, the most by a Cowboys linebacker since Sean Lee in 2017.
